    <h5>About the Team</h5>
            <p>Our team is based out of Palo Alto and developed by 25 year olds, our team is composed of 
                Christopher Lee, Mira Doshi, Arden McKendrick, and Hudson Thorsvik.
    We all met in 2018 when we were 25. We decided to make something compadable with AI We originally didn’t know how to code or build the Whatboard, but our team learned how to do that by ourselves.
     It took a while, but we learned how to develop AI, which we put into our whatboard. By 2023 it all payed off when we created the first Whatboard (the big one)
     after working on it for 2 years. One year later we sent it along with many others big sizes and a few small ones to a lucky middle school in Palo Alto California!
      We hope that in 2 years(2026) schools and offices around California are using Whatboards. In 2028 we want to have Whatboards being used across the west coast!

    <h2><b>About us</h2></b>
    <p>Christopher- I was the <b>first child</b> born in Antarctica, and lived with penguins. They were very nice, and very warm.
         However, it didn't smell so great. I loved my time there, but the education was a little lacking, so when I went to Witty Wisdom college, it finally allowed me to study penguins even more. 
         It was quite cold there, so I made a jacket out of snow that warmed me up a lot. I learned everything about them, and even learned how to communicate with them.
          I hope the whatboard is successful so I can communicate withthe other species of animals <b><i>especilly</i></b> animals that eat penguins and tell them to go away.  </p>

    <p>Hudson- I was born in 1993 in Boring, Oregon, and I can say, it was boring. 
    I didn't feel like it was challenging enough, so when I went to college at Witty Wisdom college
    it was just amazing to have something that challenged me. I hope the whatboard is successful so that people can learn at whatever skill level they are no matter where they are.</p>
    </br><hr>
    <p>Arden- I born in Monkey’s Eyebrow, Kentucky, and moved here to Palo Alto in 2008. I pursued my dream of being average. When our company was formed, I felt higher than average and changed my dream to being above average.</p>
    </br><hr>
    <p>Mira- I was born in 1993 in Truth or Concequenes, New Mexico and then moved to Menlo Park, Califonia in 2000. 
        Then I met Arden, Chistopher, and Hudson at Witty Wisdom Collage.
        I hope that the Whatboard is sucesful and one day is used across the world!</p>
